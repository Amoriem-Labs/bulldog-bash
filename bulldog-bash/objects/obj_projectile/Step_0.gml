x += image_xscale*speed;

//goal:
//add destruction upon collision with another char
//add destruction after flying for a duration/outside map
//add projectile limit: only x can appear at a time
//*make speed/movement more versatile/following a pattern if needed
//fix dashing so it checks for player instead of char (Very easy, follow same step as proj)
